# React Native Guided Access Control (RNGAC)

RNGAC is an easy-to-use library built for React Native applications. It enables developers to control iOS Guided Access mode programmatically, offering a seamless way to manage settings and status directly within your app.

**Note:** This library is iOS specific and will not work for Android.  
**Note:** This library will only function as intended if the iOS device is enrolled in Apple's Mobile Device Management (MDM) program, and the app itself must be enabled for this mode by MDM.
